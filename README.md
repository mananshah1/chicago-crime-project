Publicly available Chicago crime data

I analyzed the publicly accesible Chicago crimes dataset located here- https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2

I made some vizualizations using ggplot of the top 12 crimes in Chicago as well as the areas of arrest.

I hope you enjoy the work.
